This repository contains the source of [Haskell for Data Science](https://jonocarroll.github.io/h4ds/), an adaptation of [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.hadley.nz) book.
The book is built using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/).

This book is part of the [DataHaskell](https://www.datahaskell.org/) project and is currently a work in progress.

## Translations

Our goal is to 'translate' each section of R4DS into Haskell, leveraging the tools of DataHaskell, e.g. [dataframe](https://dataframe.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
If you spot any errors, deficiencies, or can identify some improvements, feel free to open an [Issue](https://github.com/jonocarroll/h4ds/issues).

## Code of Conduct

Please note that r4ds uses a [Contributor Code of Conduct](https://contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.html).
